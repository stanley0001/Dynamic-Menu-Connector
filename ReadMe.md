provide users with an interactive menu-driven experience. It enables the
creation and management of dynamic menus, allowing businesses and
organizations to deliver personalized services efficiently.

messages from WhatsApp. These messages are processed and can trigger
specific actions based on the content.

WhatsApp users. The service provides functions to send text messages,
media files, and more.

The WhatsApp Menu Connector enables the creation of dynamic menus. Menus can
be customized with options, descriptions, and actions. The service
supports both numeric options and full-text search menus.

# Menu Options 
Menu options are the choices presented to users within a menu. The WhatsApp Menu
Connector allows you to define options for each menu item, which can
trigger specific actions or navigate to other menus. Refer to the Menu
Options guide for instructions on creating and managing menu options.
